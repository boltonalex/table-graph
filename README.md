### Tech Test Response:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

I've also used a typescript template.

I've added the following packages:

 * c3
 * d3
 * react-router
 * react-table
 * styled-components
 * material-ui

The site structure:

* Table
* Graphs
	* Averages (average salary and experience per industry)
	* Industry (per industry breakdown of people and their salary/experience)
	* Individual (per person breakdown of their salary/experience against their industry average)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
